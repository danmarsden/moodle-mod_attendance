    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Attendance" in site administration
    And I follow "Default status set"
    And I set the field with xpath "//*[@id='statusrow2']/td[3]/input" to "customstatusdescription"
    And I click on "Update" "button" in the "#preferencesform" "css_element"
    And I should see "Status updated"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Modified default status set added to new attendance

    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Attendance" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Name        | Attendance1       |
    And I am on the "Attendance1" "mod_attendance > View" page
    And I click on "More" "link" in the ".secondary-navigation" "css_element"
    And I select "Status set" from secondary navigation
    Then the field with xpath "//*[@id='statusrow2']/td[3]/input" matches value "customstatusdescription"
